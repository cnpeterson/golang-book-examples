// Ways to define things
// In practice the first two are generally best.
/*
    s := ""
    Can only be used in a function.
*/
/*
    var _ string
    Relies on default initialization to the zero value for strings aka ""
*/
/*
    var _ = ""
    Rarely used except when declaring multiple variables
*/

/*
    var _ string = ""
    Is explicit about the variable's type, which is redundant.. but necessary in cases where they are not of the same type
*/
